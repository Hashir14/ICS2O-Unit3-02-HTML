    <h1 class="title"> Practice Using The CSS Box Model</h1>
    <p class="intro">Today we will explore the CSS Box Model. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. Content is the content of the box, where text and images appear. Padding is a clear area around the content which provides some space between the content and the border. The border goes around the padding and content. It can be coloured for decoration. Finally the margin creates some space outside the border. The margin is also transparent, just like the padding. Below are some examples of various examples of the Box Model. This paragraph is also an example.</p>
